Chores List App 

Description: Built using Vanilla JavaScript. My second project, it was built to gain more understanding of OOP, events, DOM traversal and manipulation. 

After this project, I realized that I would need to invest much more time into learning CSS and responsive design. 

Some thoughts about possibly improving this app: add the possibility to manually add new chores. Connect a database to keep track of all finished chores
in a certain time period. 

How to use: To move a chore from Active to Finished or vice-versa, click on the "Finish" or "Activate" buttons. You can also drag and drop the chores
to the Active/Finished list. Click on more info to display extra info, click on the pop-up extra info bubble to dismiss it.
